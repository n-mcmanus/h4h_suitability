# H4H Suitability

This repo generates maps of relative suitability for the Herding for Health (H4H) program within sub-Saharan Africa based on LULC and benefits to carbon.

## H4H:
H4H is a community-driven livestock management model borne out of a partnership between Peace Parks Foundation and Conservation International. The program aims *"to restore rangelands, improve animal health and provide market access â€” while promoting biodiversity conservation in and around protected areas in Africa."* More information can be found at the corresponding [PPF](https://www.peaceparks.org/h4h/) and [CI](https://www.conservation.org/projects/herding-for-health) websites. 


## Data:
Most data used for this analysis are too large to host in the repository, but sources are cited both in the scripts and below:
* **GLAD 2020 LULC:** This global land cover and land use dataset is divided into 10x10 degree tiles, each of which has a spatial resolution of ~30m at the equator. These data can be directly downloaded from [GLAD Labs](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/GLCLUC2020). 
* **NatureBase carbon data:** This global dataset quantifies the carbon emission reduction potential from activities associated with different natural climate solution (NCS) pathways. Data is available at ~90m resolution from the [naturebase web application](https://app.naturebase.org/data).
